            <h2>Mercedes</h2>
            The three-pointed star.
            Whether it appears as a hood ornament or a fisted-sized logo bulging out of an SUV’s grille,
            the Mercedes-Benz emblem is instantly recognizable — and rightfully so.
            Mercedes can trace its origins back to the first modern automobile,
            and it’s made just about every type of vehicle imaginable.
            From luxury sedans to humble taxis, and from trucks to Formula One race cars,
            Mercedes has done it all. Out of the myriad of models to wear the three-pointed star,
            here are the best Mercedes-Benz cars of all time.

            <h2>BMW</h2>
            Is it solely because of the cars they make, or is it the company as a whole?
            Is it due to its design, tradition, quality, reliability or the brand’s philosophy that attracts you?
            It can be anything and everything from the interior smell to the driver’s position to the colors offered and even the cup holders!

            <h2>Honda</h2>
            Honda makes some of the most popular cars in Canada and since the company came
            to Canada in 1969 millions of Canadians have come to love their new or used Honda.
            But how did they become so popular?
            There are many reasons, but people often talk about a few in particular.

            <h2>Kia</h2>

            <h2>Cadillac</h2>
            Cadillac innovation isn’t just what we do; it’s coded in our DNA.

            <h2>Ferrari</h2>
            Ferrari has never offered a two seat car in AWD/4WD - unlike rivals Lamborghini, Porsche, etc.
            Every street and racing Ferrari has been RWD. AWD was introduced in the Ferrari FF four seater and continued onto their GTC/4 Lusso.
            Ferrari utilizes sophisticated traction control systems to ensure the level of safety that others typically use AWD for.

            <h2>Maserati</h2>
            Every Maserati is like a work of art constructed with the care and attention that only the human hand can provide.
            Commission your very own Maserati and customize it to fit your needs.

            <h2>Nissan</h2>
            Wouldn’t it be cool if every time you went for a drive, confidence came along for the ride?
            Nissan uses a comprehensive approach to safety that guides the engineering and development of every vehicle we make.
            It’s our way of looking out for you and yours by monitoring, responding and protecting to help keep you and your passengers safe.
